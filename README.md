# __Lotto Game First Back- End Java Technology__

Hello again!

This is my first simple back-end project which was made to sum up my current skills in Java language. 
AS I indicated in my previous projects I study back-end fields right now connected with Java. So I'd like to to invite to have a look at my first Lotto Game project.

***
So let's check this project out!

Mostly, my main point was to focus on basics of Java. To provide proper functionality, and clear code I try to used tools and rules which definitely helped me. 
I am aware of this is only beggining but despite lots of responsibilities I am really determined to study lots of new stuff to be the best in this profession.
So be welcomed to visit and have a look at my work!

## About project:
__To build this project I used:__

1. Java OOP 
2. JUnit Test
    - UserInputTest- check numbers provided by user
 
3. Maven
- provide dependecies: JUnit, Lombok, Mockito
4. Git/Github connections

## What next?
I am going to improve my current skills, but in the nearest future I'm going to start learning Java Spring.

__JS technology__
1. The restaurant program made a few yeras ago, but updating with actual api. I need to rewrite lots of code to provide actuall working app. 
So probably it's going to be new APP in this field.

__Java technology__
1. Simple Lotto game;
2. Home budget calculator (in progress...)
3. Next projects connected with Java/Spring etc. technology

In the meantime I'm trying to get my first commercial experience by focusing on finding an intership or a first job.
I'm aware of my current programing skills and I need still working on my stack. 
However I'd like to do this with professionals.

I offer you my current skills, hard working, good attitude and aproche with getting new knowledge. 

I will be gald if you give me some feedback or ...
If you are interested give me a chance to work with you, just let me know on my e-mail: __b.wr00bel@gmail.com__
